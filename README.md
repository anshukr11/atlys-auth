# Atlys Authentication Project

This is a React application with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS, focusing on user authentication and routing.

## Project Structure

The project appears to have the following structure:

```
atlys-authp/
├── src/
│   ├── common/
│   │   └── Modal/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── Home/
│   │   ├── Login/
│   │   ├── PostFeed/
│   │   ├── ProtectedRoute/
│   │   └── Signup/
│   └── hooks/
├── public/
├── App.tsx
├── index.tsx
└── ...
```

## Features

- User authentication (login, logout, signup)
- Protected routes
- Feed page for authenticated users

## Main Components

- `App`: The main component that sets up routing and authentication state
- `Home`: Likely the landing page
- `Login`: Handles user login
- `Signup`: Handles user registration
- `PostFeed`: Displays content for authenticated users
- `ProtectedRoute`: A wrapper component to secure routes that require authentication

## Authentication

The project uses a custom `useAuth` hook to manage authentication state and related functions.

## Routing

React Router is used for navigation. The main routes are:

- `/`: Home page
- `/login`: Login page
- `/signup`: Signup page
- `/feed`: Protected route for authenticated users

## Styling

Tailwind CSS is used for styling, as evidenced by the Tailwind class names in the code.
